# Dark-Karma-Bot
This is our Discord bot I have started working on. Right now it is pretty simple but will get more advanced over time. To many bots these days try charging monthly
subscriptions for the most basic things and I for one am tired of it. So our bot looks to replace those silly practices and give power back to the communities. If you
like the bot, or just want to contribute to it, feel free.

# Who can use the bot?
Anyone. Like I said, this bot aims to give power back to communities. Chances are you will want to edit some of the command replies and the group IDs to match your own info.
But this bot is free to use by anyone, no credits needed. Keep in mind this is just the source code. You will need your own token and bot settings on the developer portal of
Discord. Other than that, you can drop the app.js file in and it will work.

# What exactly do I need to make this bot work?
Besides your own token and bot settings on the dev portal for Discord, you are going to need to install two modules as shown in the source code. The first is Discord.js which you should already have if you're looking to host a bot, and the second is mathjs. With those two modules in, your own token, and bot settings, nothing else is needed. You can install the modules by going to your platform and entering the following -

npm install discord.js

npm install mathjs
